# What's new for Surface Hub 3

[!INCLUDE [Hub MTR Scope](includes/hub-mtr-scope.md)]

## Introduction

Surface Hub 3, available in 50-inch and 85-inch models, delivers an inclusive hybrid collaboration experience through the Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows platform. Designed end-to-end by Microsoft, Surface Hub 3 is the [premier all-in-one hybrid meeting and collaboration device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxasUd908k&t=1s) built for modern work. It brings advanced features and **AI-powered interactive experiences** to elevate collaboration and create an engaging, efficient environment, empowering hybrid teams to be more productive together than ever.

## Hybrid meetings that include everyone

Dissolve boundaries for hybrid teams with a device designed to make meetings more inclusive. Surface Hub running Teams Rooms on Windows provides a premium, AI-powered experience certified for Microsoft Teams. Users can seamlessly join meetings across different platforms like Zoom, Cisco Webex, (and Google Meet, anticipated October 2024).

- [Surface Hub Smart Camera](surface-hub-smart-camera.md) offers remote participants the best possible view of the room.  
  - Ultra-wide 136-degree field of view with high-quality glass optics and a low-light sensor.
  - Surface Hub Smart Camera integrates with **IntelliFrame** to keep participants in view as they move or interact with content, ensuring a dynamic and inclusive meeting experience.<sup>1</sup>
- **One-touch join**: Join Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or Webex meetings with a single tap on the home screen.
- **Facial expressions and body language** are vividly rendered on the 4K touchscreen display, delivering a more natural and inclusive experience for remote and in-room participants.

### AI-powered speaker recognition

Surface Hub running Teams Rooms on Windows introduces **AI-powered speaker recognition**, enhancing the meeting experience by identifying individual voices in the room (for participants who have opted in through voice enrollment). With clear consent and privacy in mind, this feature ensures that meeting contributions are accurately attributed to each speaker, supporting better follow-up and collaboration. Background noise is suppressed, creating a clearer, more focused environment for all participants.

- **Speaker recognition**: Identifies participants' voices in the room by analyzing vocal characteristics, ensuring individual contributions are tracked. 
  - **Voice enrollment**: End users can easily create a voice profile via [aka.ms/voiceprofile](https://aka.ms/voiceprofile), allowing their voice to be recognized in meetings. 
  - **IT administration**: Admins can manage voice and face enrollment for specific users, groups of users, or an entire organization, ensuring secure and accurate identification. To learn more, see [Overview of voice and face enrollment](/microsoftteams/rooms/voice-and-face-recognition).

- **Facilitator integration**: Powered by speaker recognition, Facilitator<sup>1</sup> (targeted for public preview in Q1 2025) takes meeting notes in real time, tracks decisions, and automatically creates follow-up tasks, helping teams focus on discussions instead of manual follow-ups.

- **Biometric privacy and security** are a top priority. Microsoft encrypts voice and face data at rest and in transit, adhering to strict privacy guidelines and regulatory requirements for data protection. Users can unenroll their voice profiles at any time, and profiles are automatically deleted if unused for one year.

### Intuitive in-room controls

**[QR Code Join](/microsoftteams/rooms/teams-rooms-qr-codes)** simplifies how users wireless cast content, connect to meetings, and remotely manage meeting controls. Scan the QR code displayed on Surface Hub to join or control meetings directly from your mobile device using **Proximity Join**. Once in the companion mode, use your mobile device to manage common meeting functions such as camera on/off, mute, and layout adjustments directly from your device, without leaving your seat.

### Center-of-table console support

Surface Hub 3 now supports **third-party center-of-table consoles**, providing an additional option for controlling meetings. These **Teams Rooms Certified Universal Consoles**, starting with hardware from MAXHUB, allow users to manage Surface Hub meetings from a touchpad at the conference room table. Console support simplifies meeting operations, including joining meetings and wired content sharing,<sup>2</sup> while also making Surface Hub suitable for front-of-room deployments. Universal Console support is targeted for general availability in **Q2 of 2025**.

Microsoft [announced at Ignite 2024](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/SurfaceITPro/enhancing-collaboration-with-microsoft-teams-rooms-and-surface-hub-3/4292453) that Surface Hub 3 will bring support for **third-party center-of-table consoles** in 2025, providing an additional option for controlling meetings. This new ecosystem of **Teams Rooms Certified Universal Consoles**, starting with hardware from MAXHUB, will allow consoles to be separately purchased and deployed with touch board Teams Rooms on Windows devices, starting with Surface Hub. This will enable users to manage meetings in a familiar way from the touchpad while seated at the conference room table. Not only will console support simplify meeting operations, including joining meetings, but it will also provide an entry point for wired content sharing from individualsâ€™ PCs.<sup>2</sup>  Console support will make it easier to deploy Surface Hub 3 in a greater variety of meeting spaces, including front-of-room positions, and drive consistency across all Teams Rooms in your buildings. Universal Console support is targeted for general availability in **Q2 of 2025**.


## Manage remotely and stay secure anywhere

Surface Hub running Teams Rooms on Windows empowers IT admins with enterprise-grade tools to manage devices and maintain security from anywhere.

- **Low-touch deployment**: Quickly deploy devices using Windows Autopilot, and use auto-sign-in capabilities for seamless integration with Azure Directory.
- **Security and compliance**: Ensure data protection with BitLocker, Trusted Platform Module 2.0 (TPM), and Microsoft Defender for cloud-powered security. Enable [Conditional Access policies](/mem/intune/protect/conditional-access) to safeguard sign-ins on shared devices.

## Surface Hub platform differences

For customers with Surface Hub 2S (or Surface Hub v1) devices that have used the legacy Windows 10 Team edition experience previously in their organization, we understand that transitioning operating systems to the new Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows platform introduces change management considerations. Many customers ask about the differences between the legacy Windows 10 Team edition on Surface Hub 2S and the new [Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows platform](/microsoftteams/rooms/). This new platform provides Surface Hub with a modern, secure, integrated, and consistent Teams Rooms experience designed for hybrid collaboration. It powers new Surface Hub 3 devices, Surface Hub 2S devices upgraded with the **Surface Hub 3 Compute Cartridge,** and Surface Hub 2S devices that have been software-migrated from the legacy OS, to the new platform.
