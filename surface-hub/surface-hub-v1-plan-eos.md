# Planning for End of Support for Surface Hub v1 devices

As the Windows 10 Team edition OS reaches [End of Support on October 14, 2025](/lifecycle/products/windows-10-team-surface-hub), Microsoft recommends organizations begin planning and budgeting for device upgrades or alternative conferencing solutions. Although Surface Hub v1 might still function with that OS, [Microsoft no longer provides hardware support for these devices](/surface-hub/surface-hub-driver-firmware-accessories-lifecycle#legacy-products). Transitioning to newer solutions, such as Surface Hub 3, ensures your organization maintains optimal performance, security, and support.

For continued use of Surface Hub v1, consider using [Replacement PC Mode](/surface-hub/connect-and-display-with-surface-hub#replacement-pc-mode) by connecting an external PC. However,  this workaround doesn't extend the deviceâ€™s hardware support lifespan. 

To avoid disruption, we recommend completing the transition before Windows 10 Team edition support ends in October 2025. For guidance on available upgrade options and planning assistance, contact your [Surface device reseller](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/business/where-to-buy-microsoft-surface) or [Microsoft support representative](/surface/contact-surface-business-education-support).
