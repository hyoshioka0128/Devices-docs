# Surface repair by Microsoft Authorized Service Providers

We're committed to delivering exceptional service and support by continuously expanding our network of Authorized Service Providers (ASPs). These trusted partners work directly with Microsoft to resolve issues with your Microsoft devices. All ASPs perform repairs on Microsoft’s behalf, have direct access to Microsoft support, and use genuine Microsoft parts to ensure quality and reliability.

## How it works

All authorized service providers (ASPs) offer **depot repair**, while some also provide the option for **onsite repair** based on availability and your location:

- **Onsite repair (available at select ASPs):** If available, a skilled technician will come to your location to evaluate and repair the device, minimizing downtime.  
- **Depot repair (available at all ASPs):** The ASP collects your device and transports it to their repair center, where it is thoroughly inspected and repaired by an expert technician. Once the repair is complete, the device is returned to you.

### Reseller vs. Non-Reseller ASPs

Non-Reseller ASPs (designated by an asterisk * on this page) partner with Resellers as non-competing entities, focusing solely on providing repair services. This distinction ensures that Resellers can collaborate comfortably with Non-Reseller ASPs without concerns about competition. Resellers have the flexibility to either white label the Non-Reseller ASP repair services or have ASPs work directly with customers, depending on the business arrangement. This partnership model supports seamless repair services while preserving the Reseller's relationship with the customer.

## Global ASP network

The growing ASP network consists of more than 160 locations. Select your region to explore available ASPs:
