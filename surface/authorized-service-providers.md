# Surface repair by Microsoft authorized service providers

We're committed to delivering exceptional service and support by continuously expanding our network of authorized service providers (ASPs). These trusted partners work directly with Microsoft to resolve issues with your Microsoft devices. All ASPs perform repairs on Microsoftâ€™s behalf, have direct access to Microsoft support, and use genuine Microsoft parts to ensure quality and reliability.

## How it works

Depending on your needs, ASP technicians provide one of the following services:

- **Onsite repair:** A skilled technician will come to your location to evaluate and repair the device, minimizing downtime.  
- **Depot repair:** The ASP collects the device and transports it to their repair center, where it is thoroughly inspected and repaired by an expert technician. Once the repair is complete, the device is returned to your location.

## Global ASP network

The growing ASP network consists of more than 160 locations. Select your region to explore available ASPs:

- [Americas](#americas)
- [Europe](#europe)
- [Asia Pacific](#asia-pacific)
