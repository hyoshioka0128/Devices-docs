# Surface security overview

As cyber threats evolve, strategies to combat them must evolve as well. Microsoft Surface adopts a proactive, "Zero Trust" approach to addressing emerging threats by embedding advanced security features at every level by default—from hardware to cloud services, from product conception to decommission—ensuring Surface devices remain highly secure, adaptable, and resilient throughout the entirety of their lifecycle.

Chip to cloud security is central to the Surface strategy. We deliver strong platform protections with powerful Windows 11 security capabilities enabled by default. As we move towards an AI-enabled future, Surface helps organizations strengthen their security posture across hardware, OS, data, apps, and identity with a foundation of built-in protection.

## Secured Surface supply chain

To help ensure that Surface devices are "secure by design, secure by default, and secure in deployment," Microsoft applies rigorous security controls across the entire product lifecycle. These controls cover both physical hardware and software components. Surface devices undergo strict security reviews starting from conception, moving through design, development, production, delivery, and maintenance. These comprehensive security reviews support a seamless chain of trust throughout the device lifecycle.

At the manufacturing level, Microsoft conducts regular supplier audits to prevent potential threats like ransomware, phishing, and malware. Moreover, Surface devices also benefit from **Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT)** and **Transported Asset Protection Association (TAPA)** security programs, which further protect global trade and support secure logistics for shipping Surface devices worldwide.

For software, Microsoft developed the **Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)** and applied this framework across all products to proactively adapt to the changing threat landscape and regulatory demands such as **US Executive Order 14028 (“Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity”).** Additionally, Microsoft and its suppliers must digitally sign software components, use secure channels and protocols for communication, and provide timely and regular updates to Surface devices to address any potential issues. Lastly, Surface UEFI development partners with Microsoft’s open-source Project Mu to deliver a fully **Microsoft-owned Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) stack** for every Surface device, which reduces reliance on non-Microsoft firmware providers, providing transparency and protection for the lowest and most sensitive levels of your device.

By owning both hardware design and firmware development, Microsoft minimizes supply chain risks, allowing for prompt responses to any potential vulnerabilities. With these proactive practices, Surface devices are designed to meet the highest standards for both digital and physical supply chain security. This unified, in-house approach enhances the security of Surface devices before they even leave the factory.

## Microsoft designed & built components

Microsoft designs and maintains Surface devices to offer customers comprehensive control, proactive protection, and peace of mind in any work environment. Surface devices come equipped with Microsoft’s leading security features to protect you from sophisticated attacks and to simplify device management.

### Built-in Surface security

From the moment you press the power button to the time you shut down your device, Surface delivers leading-edge, built-in security throughout every stage of its lifecycle.

Every Surface device running Windows 11 out of the box uses a **Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0** that helps ensure platform integrity by preventing tampering and managing cryptographic keys for various secure operations. The TPM supports the **Hardware Root of Trust**, a dedicated module that helps create a hardware-based security boundary to ensure the device boots in a trusted state. Together, the TPM and Root of Trust function as a secured anchor for integrated encryption and secure operations, establishing the security foundation for **BitLocker**, **Virtualization-Based Security (VBS)**, **Memory Integrity/HVCI, Enhanced Sign-In Security (ESS)** for **Windows Hello for Business**, and other secure operations.

Through the virtualization and integrity checks provided by VBS and HVCI respectively, the device’s kernel is hosted separately from the operating system for a **Secured Kernel**, meaning even if the operating system is compromised, the kernel is still protected. Plus **Kernel DMA Protection** helps safeguard device memory from direct memory access (DMA) drive-by attacks by securing the kernel against external peripherals gaining unauthorized access to memory.

To support the integrity of device bootup at power-on, Secure Boot uses the device’s Root of Trust to prevent unauthorized firmware from running at boot time. Enabled by **Microsoft-built UEFI** and **TPM 2.0**, it helps ensure that only authorized firmware runs before the OS loads. This firmware must originate from Microsoft, its Independent Hardware Vendors (IHVs), or approved open-source repositories and remain unmodified during transit and provisioning onto the device. This process safeguards the integrity of the firmware at each stage of the boot sequence—from pressing the power button to launching the OS. As part of **System Guard Secure Launch**, Surface devices also protect bootup using **Dynamic Root of Trust Measurement (DRTM)** or **Firmware Attack Surface Reduction (FASR)**,[<sup>1</sup>](#references) which both establish a hardware-based root of trust designed to ensure the integrity of the boot process and defend against firmware-level attacks.

Many of these out-of-box security features form the foundation of [Secured-Core PC (SCPC)](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/business/windows-11-secured-core-computers), which integrates hardware, firmware, and virtualization to protect devices from various threats, including malware, physical possession issues (like loss or theft), and access attacks. SCPC helps protect data even if a device is compromised.

Since late 2021, every Surface device running Windows 11 is a Secured-Core PC, with the highest level of protection enabled out-of-the-box. The following security features are a subset of those features enabled by default for all SCPC Surface devices:

## Surface commercial security advantage

### Remote management

IT admins can remotely manage Surface devices. **Microsoft Intune** admin center with Intune and **Windows Autopilot** enables full remote management of Surface devices from the Azure Cloud, delivering fully configured devices to users upon startup. Wipe and retire features enable IT to quickly repurpose a device for a new remote user or wipe a device that's been stolen. These capabilities enable rapid and secure responses, allowing remote removal of all company data and reconfiguration of a Surface as an entirely new device.

As part of Microsoft Intune, **Device Firmware Configuration Interface (DFCI)** allows cloud-based management of firmware settings including remote disabling of hardware and locking of UEFI settings. As a similar alternative, **Surface Enterprise Management Mode (SEMM)** is another management solution to secure and manage firmware settings within an organization.

### Responsive security

In a rapidly evolving digital age, the ability to react quickly and proactively is paramount. **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** offers AI-driven, real-time protection against advanced threats, helping protect sensitive data and communications. Organizations benefit from the power of  **Windows Update for Business** by using a Microsoft-maintained stack of both firmware and OS applications. This service keeps systems current with the latest security protections and allows for IT management of already commissioned devices.
